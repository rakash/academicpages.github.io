    Statistics is a branch of mathematics working with data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation.<br/>
    Statistics is very important to understand the theories behind Machine Learning and Deep Learning. <br/>
    Statistics can be majorly divided into: <br/>
    
    <li> <a href="https://rakash.github.io/teaching/desstats-1">Descriptive Statistics</a></li>
    <li> Inferential Statistics </li> <br/>
        
  <a href = "https://rakash.github.io/teaching/resdes">Research Design</a> is an important topic before you get into descriptive and inferential statistics. <br/><br/>

    Analytics is a collection of techniques and tools used for creating value from data.<br/>
    Techniques include concepts such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms.<br/>
    AI, ML, and DL are defined as follows:<br/>
    1. Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms and systems that exhibit human-like intelligence.
    2. Machine Learning: Subset of AI that can learn to perform a task with extracted data and/or models.
    3. Deep Learning: Subset of machine learning that imitate the functioning of human brain to solve problems.
