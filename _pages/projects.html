<h1>Face Disparity Check Using Deep Learning</h1>

<p>
Have you ever wondered how KYC platforms work?
The ones that involve face validations digitally while processing a customers application.
<br>
<a href="http://face-disparity.herokuapp.com/">Here</a> is a simple app that checks the disparity between an uploaded face with an existing database of faces.
<br>
The app uses embeddings generated using the facenet model. The paper for the same can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832">here</a>
