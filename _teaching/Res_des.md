When trying to make sense of the world using statistics, itâ€™s important to consider
which type of research design will provide you with the most accurate answer for
the type of question you are asking.Typically, the selection of a particular design
involves an amount of horse trading between the extent to which a research environment
is able to be controlled versus only being able to be observed, and
whether the research goal involves determining some underlying cause for a
phenomenon (science), or whether the goal is to optimize the yield or output for a
specific process while minimizing effort (technology).

The two main types of research design are;  


1. [Experimental Study](https://www.google.com)
2. [Observational Study](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rakash/Observational_Studies/blob/master/Observational%20Study%20-%20%20A%20Primer.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
